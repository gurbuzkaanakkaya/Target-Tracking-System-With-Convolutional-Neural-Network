## Optimization

The masking process was used during the follow-up to frame a certain part of the real-time image in order to isolate it from external factors and reduce the margin of error.

  


  
## Features

- Ability to select seven different OpenCV tracking algorithms. 
- Simultaneous tracking of the selected target on the "x" and "y" axis.
- Analyzing the frames taken simultaneously with the tracking according to the trained neural network.
- Ability to see the accuracy rates of simultaneous frames received with tracking according to the trained neural network.
- Mobile robot motor controls in accordance with the accuracy rate.
